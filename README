Signal is a non-graphical client, in three parts.
  - Signal Red is a UT3-compatible query pinger. 
  - Signal Yellow includes text chat.
  - Signal Green includes voice chat. If we impliment voice. 

Signal is the first client to be written for ProtOasis.
It will help to test development of Depot, itself a development server for testing Signal, and later Station, the main game server.

Signal will be available for iOS, Android, Linux, macOS, WebRTC and Win10 app. 

***Just a thought***
It has come to my attention that "Signal" is a brand and product, signal.org.  It is an encrypted messanger app.
This could potentially lead Signal into Signal Green+, with game query, text chat, voice calls, and messenger service. 
Building Signal Green around this software would allow for a external communication for the community. 

However, choosing not to do so, ProtOasis Signal will remain the name, as it differs itself as a package part of a larger product.
